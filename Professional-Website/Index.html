              I enjoy finding new things to do, especially when I get to 
              spend time with family. I have found recently that I enjoy taking care of 
              the animals on my aunt and uncles farm. Unfortunately I realized this
              after my uncle passed away from a heart attack. I only got to go to the sale barn
              with him once and that is one of my favorite memories I have with him. What he left behind
              is incredible and I hope he knows that I am helping my aunt take care of everything.

              During the summer there is NOTHING that beats lake days and

              table Games with family and friends. There is never a dull moment
              at Grand Lake, especially on the 4th of July! We got a place in a campground near Grand Lake 
              a couple of years ago and met two other families who were also from Claremore!

              I have played a variety of sports growing up but once I got to
              highschool I had to pick two. I decided to run cross
              country and continue playing soccer. I was also very honored to
              make all-state as a senior and participate in the all-state game
              in Carl Albert. Starting out on JV was the best thing that could have
              happened as it pushed me to be better.

              After graduating Justus-Tiawah, a small K-8th grade school, I attended Claremore High School. I was 
              pretty scared jumping from a class of 55 to about 400, but I quickly made new friends.
              Throughout highschool I wasn't sure what I wanted to do, but that changed Junior year.
              I thought I wanted to go into cybersecurity but unfortunately my school didn't offer 
              a class that taught that. Senior year, my favorite teacher told me that he was teaching
              a coding class and he thought I should join. I instantly found a love for coding and I was addicted to it.
              I would always come home and code small games such as hangman.

              After doing research I found The University of Oklahoma Fullstack Academy. I had the option to go to college
              but I decided that I wanted to further my knowledge in coding and learn in a different style. I also have gained
              responsibility by having to pay monthly for school on my own. This bootcamp was one of my best decisions of my life
              as I met incredible teammates and people. My instructor was amazing and I am extremely lucky to have been taught by
              him. He gave me resources that I continue to use to help myself learn everyday. I am glad that I got real job experience
              that I can use in my next job!

              With a certificate in web development and knowing both front-end and back-end I know that I am able to contribute to 
              any needs that my team needs. I love front-end development and being able to be creative in any projects that the 
              client may want. Having a knowledge in back-end development gives me an advantage and I will leverage that to the 
              best of my ability. I am excited to be able to work for a company that gives me an opportunity and I know that 
              I will exceed the expectations that I am given. I believe that no mountain is too high to climb, although Mount Everest
              may not be for me lol!

            My cousin has been extremely helpful for giving me advice on school and where to go next.
            Having someone so succesful like him is something that I do not take for granted. From being accepted
            into Honors at RSU, graduating from law school and passing the BAR exam the first time, starting out as a lawyer
            at a firm, and now working for the FBI in the court room is extremely motivating for me to be just as succesful as him.
